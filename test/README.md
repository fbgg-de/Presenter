# test/

Tooling for running and inspecting the app without a real backend.

## Mock backend

`mock-backend/` is a small Node HTTP server that answers `/rest/*` with fixture JSON in the same
shapes as the PHP API. It exists so the frontend can be opened, clicked through and screenshotted
on a machine with no PHP/MySQL — for layout work, responsive checks, and reproducing UI bugs.

```bash
npm run dev:web:mock
```

That starts the mock backend on `:8000` and the Vite dev server on `:5173` together (the dev
proxy in `vite.shared.ts` already forwards `/rest` and `/oidc` to `:8000`, so nothing else is
configured). Open http://localhost:5173 and you are logged in as account 1.

Run the pieces separately if you prefer:

```bash
npm run dev:mock
```

### Options

| Env var      | Effect                                                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `MOCK_PORT`  | Port to listen on (default `8000`, which is what the Vite proxy expects) |
| `MOCK_ADMIN` | `1` returns an `oidc_admin` session, unlocking `/admin`                  |

```bash
MOCK_ADMIN=1 npm run dev:mock
```

### What it does and does not do

- **Reads** return data from `mock-backend/fixtures.mjs`.
- **Writes** (POST/PUT/DELETE) are acknowledged and kept in memory for the life of the process,
  so a rename or delete sticks until you restart. Nothing is persisted or validated.
- **Unmapped endpoints** answer `{}` rather than 404, so a screen that polls something the mock
  does not know about still renders. Watch the request log — unmapped paths are flagged there.

It is a fixture server, not a simulator. Do not use it to verify backend behaviour; use it to
verify what the UI does with a given payload.

### Fixtures

`mock-backend/fixtures.mjs` holds the data. It is deliberately awkward — long German titles with
umlauts, 7-digit CCLI numbers, multi-author credits, a set list entry carrying both a custom key
and a long block-order name, and a duplicate song pair for the admin merge screen. Layout bugs
surface on strings like these and hide behind `Song 1`.

Song blocks contain placeholders (`[verse line 1]`), never real lyrics.

Add a case by editing that file; add an endpoint by extending `handlers` in `server.mjs`.

## Checking a viewport

The mobile layouts assume MUI's `sm` breakpoint (< 600px) via `useIsMobile()`. When checking a
change, look at 375×812 (phone) and something ≥ 900px (desktop) — several components swap their
structure rather than just reflowing, so a change that looks right on one can regress the other.
