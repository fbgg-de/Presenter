/**
 * Presenter Live Viewer — configuration template.
 *
 * Copy this file to `config.php` next to it and fill in the values:
 *
 *     cp config-example.php config.php
 *
 * `config.php` is git-ignored, so the token never reaches version control and
 * pulling a new version of the viewer cannot overwrite your settings.
 *
 * The token may be left empty when the page is always opened with `?token=…`
 * (the link the Presenter app builds under Settings → Viewer Token). A token
 * given in the URL always wins over the one configured here, so one deployed
 * copy can serve both a fixed screen and per-account links.
 *
 * Save `config.php` as UTF-8 WITHOUT a byte-order mark. PHP echoes a BOM as page
 * output before any header is sent, which silently turns the viewer's 400/503
 * error responses into 200s and puts stray bytes at the top of the page. Windows
 * editors and PowerShell's `Set-Content -Encoding utf8` add one by default.
