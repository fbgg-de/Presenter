/**
 * The audio-mixer protocol, in two halves.
 *
 * **Streamer's bridge** is the contract documented in Streamer's
 * `docs/audio-bridge-contract.md`: a websocket on the LAN that speaks in mixes, strips
 * and levels so nothing here has to know OSC, or whether the desk is an X32 or an XR16.
 *
 * **The relay envelope** is ours, and exists because musicians reach this app over
 * https. A browser blocks `ws://<lan-ip>` from an https page as mixed content, with no
 * override, so a phone cannot talk to the bridge directly. Instead the operator holds
 * the single bridge socket and forwards the parts of it a given musician is allowed to
 * see through the wss relay the app already runs.
 *
 * That indirection buys more than reachability. The operator sits in the command path,
 * so a musician who may not touch the main mix is *refused*, not merely shown a screen
 * without the button — which is the difference between a permission and a decoration.
 *
 * Nothing in here imports from the app: the operator host, the musician client and the
 * lazily-loaded mixer UI all share these types, and the mixer chunk must not drag the
 * store in behind them.
