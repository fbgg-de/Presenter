/**
 * Slice persistence to localStorage, with a priority order for what survives when the
 * origin's storage runs out.
 *
 * Two separate problems are solved here.
 *
 * **A write must never abort the state change.** Every slice persists itself from INSIDE
 * its Immer reducer, so a throwing `localStorage.setItem` aborts the whole `produce` and
 * RTK discards the action — the setting silently does not apply. That is how a full quota
 * once froze the MIDI follow chip in the "on" position and stopped the open show from
 * being remembered, both at once and with no error anywhere.
 *
 * **Not everything stored is equally important.** In priority order:
 *
 *   1. Settings, the open show, musician settings — small, irreplaceable, never evicted.
 *   2. Offline data for the songs in the CURRENT SHOW — the minimum needed to present
 *      without a server. Given up only when nothing else is left.
 *   3. Everything else: songs from other shows, cached styles. Re-fetchable, so these go
 *      first and are also capped proactively (see `registerEvictor` callers).
 *
 * Tier 3 is trimmed on a budget as it grows, so in practice the quota is never reached;
 * the eviction below is the safety net for when it is anyway.
