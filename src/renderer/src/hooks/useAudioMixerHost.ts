/**
 * useAudioMixerHost — the operator's half of monitor mixing.
 *
 * It owns the one websocket to Streamer's audio bridge and re-serves it to the account's
 * musicians over the WS relay. Musicians cannot open that socket themselves: they load
 * this app over https, and a browser refuses `ws://<lan-ip>` from an https page as mixed
 * content. So the operator, which is on the same LAN as the desk and not subject to that
 * rule, stands in the middle.
 *
 * Standing in the middle is also where the permissions live. A musician asking to mute
 * the main gets an `ok: false` here, not a screen that merely lacks the button — the
 * difference between a rule and a suggestion. Everything leaving this hook is filtered
 * to the mixes that musician is allowed before it is sent, so a client that lies about
 * its own permissions still never receives what it may not have.
 *
 * Runs inside `usePresentationSync`, which already owns the operator's relay socket. It
 * is a passenger on that connection rather than a second one — an operator appearing
 * twice in its own connected-clients list would be its own bug report.
