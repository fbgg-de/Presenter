/**
 * useMixerSession — the live desk, as one musician sees it.
 *
 * Everything here is inside the lazily-loaded mixer chunk, so none of it is downloaded
 * by a musician who never opens the mixer.
 *
 * Two things in it are less obvious than they look:
 *
 * **Meters bypass React entirely.** They arrive at 10 Hz, and re-rendering a column of
 * strips ten times a second to animate a bar is a waste of a phone's battery during a
 * service. They are published through a subscription instead, and the bars write their
 * own height — see `MixerMeter`.
 *
 * **Faders are optimistic.** The bridge's `ack` only means the command was sent; the desk
 * confirms separately by echoing the change back as a patch, over UDP, after up to 100 ms
 * of coalescing. Waiting for that would make every fader lag behind the finger. So a
 * moved fader is applied locally straight away and the local value is dropped as soon as
 * the desk's own answer arrives — or, if it never does, after {@link OPTIMISTIC_TTL_MS},
 * which is how a refused command visibly springs back instead of lying.
